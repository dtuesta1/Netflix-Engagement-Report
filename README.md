# Netflix Engagement Report
This project involves scraping data from Wikipedia to identify whether a show is a Netflix Original, as well as gathering information on its genres and languages. After thoroughly cleaning and matching this data with Netflix's engagement report, the project aims to analyze how these attributes may have contributed to a show's success, measured in terms of viewership.

- WIP: `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` 
- Complete: 
    - `Wikipedia_Web_Scraping.ipynb` contains the web scraping process, as well as cleaning and organizing the Netflix Original data
    - `Netflix_Report_Cleaned_Matched.ipynb` contains the cleaning and matching process of the Netflix Original Titles csv and the Netflix Engagement Report csv.

The Netflix Engagement Report provides viewership and engagement data for various shows and films on the platform. Here's a breakdown of the final csv I created. * indicates the wikipedia data added for certain titles.
